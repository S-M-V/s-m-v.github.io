We aim to experimentally uncover emergent quantum phenomena by exploring the delicate symbiosis between crystal growth and strongly correlated phases, as magnetism or superconductivity, ranging from bulk to the two-dimensional limit (2D materials). To do so, we use solid-state crystal growth techniques, magneto-transport measurements in 2D devices and magnetic imaging using color center magnetometry.

  A quantum ballet: spins don’t stand still. They dance, precess, fluctuate. We watch them move, measure them, and make sense of their rhythm."

<h2>Crystal growth: <em> when everything starts with plain powders</em></h2> 
<div class="highlight-quote beige">
<em>"As a rule, the substances yielded by chemical transport reactions are in the form of well-defined crystals. 
The satisfaction that the chemist experiences when he holds <strong>beautiful crystals</strong> instead of a plain powder in his hands merits more than slight consideration."</em>

Our interest is to grow high-quality single crystals for exploring their physical properties (both in bulk and in the low-dimensional limit).

put it on top of another monolayer or few-layer crystal, add another

with blocks defined with one-atomic-plane precision."</em>

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

<h2>Quantum sensing with solid-state spin-defects</h2>

The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
