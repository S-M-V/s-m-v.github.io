<em>"Quantum phenomena do not occur in a Hilbert space. They occur in a laboratory."</em>

</div>

We aim to experimentally uncover emergent quantum phenomena by exploring the delicate symbiosis between crystal growth and strongly correlated phases, as magnetism or superconductivity, ranging from bulk to the two-dimensional limit (2D materials). To do so, we use solid-state crystal growth techniques, magneto-transport measurements in 2D devices and magnetic imaging using color center magnetometry.

  A quantum ballet: spins don’t stand still. They dance, precess, fluctuate. We watch them move, measure them, and make sense of their rhythm."

<h2>Crystal growth: <em> when everything starts with plain powders</em></h2> 
<div class="highlight-quote beige">
<em>"As a rule, the substances yielded by chemical transport reactions are in the form of well-defined crystals. 
The satisfaction that the chemist experiences when he holds <strong>beautiful crystals</strong> instead of a plain powder in his hands merits more than slight consideration."</em>
<span class="quote-author"> Harald Schäfer <em>(Chemical Vapor Reactions, 1964)</em></span>
</div>

We grow high-quality single crystals to explore their physical properties, both in bulk and in the low-dimensional limit.
Our synthesis methods include solid-state crystal growth techniques such as chemical vapor transport, direct vapor transport or flux growth.

  From plain powders to beauty — van der Waals crystals shaped by thermal gradients.

<h2>2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures</h2>
<div class="highlight-quote sage">
<em>"The basic principle is simple: take, for example, a monolayer,
put it on top of another monolayer or few-layer crystal, add another
2D crystal and so on. The resulting stack represents an artificial
material assembled in a chosen sequence —as in building with Lego—
with blocks defined with one-atomic-plane precision."</em>
<span class="quote-author"> A. K. Geim & I. V. Grigorieva <em>(Nature 499, 419–425, 2013)</em></span>
</div>

Like building with atomic Lego, we isolate 2D crystals and assemble them one layer at a time into custom-made structures. 
These van der Waals heterostructures unlock new physical behaviors and enable the design of artificial magnets, 
as twisted magnets with tunable spin reversal and hysteresis, born of design rather than chance.

<h2>Quantum sensing with solid-state spin-defects</h2>
<div class="highlight-quote slate">
<em>"The more nearly an object approaches perfection, the more we notice its slightest defects."</em>
<span class="quote-author"> Sadi Carnot <em>(Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat, 1890)</em></span>
</div>

Defects can be useful — and even beautiful! — once you look with the right eyes. 
We harness solid-state spin defects, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond or boron vacancies in hBN, as quantum sensors. 
With them, we unravel the quantum dance of spins in thin-film magnetic layers, 
revealing magnetic textures and imaging spin waves with nanometer precision.
